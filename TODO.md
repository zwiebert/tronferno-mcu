TODO
====
* TODO: Add new HTTP_GET URI handler type for dynamic pages. uri_specific_handle_function(td) writes JSON to td similar to cmd.json, but using get instead of post. Will be used to serve settings.json from current settings instead of spiffs snapshot
* TODO: checkout RF Solution's AM-RRQ3-433P receiver module (used in Fernotron 2427)
* TODO: if cc1101 init fails, return zeros as register file (not random garbage)
* TODO: Improve web app ?->OTA tab
* TODO: Improve web app ?->Backup tab
* TODO: Configure tcp terminal/telnet and maybe allow user settings
* TODO: Write received auto data from 2411 (via RF) to storage in MCU
* TODO: Terminate SET progress bar in web-app when an RF command (e.g. STOP) is received
* FIXME: astro predictions lags one day behind sometimes (e.g. april-5)
* FIXME: New WLAN-only-ESP32 starts with default network=lan (maybe only in the developer version)
* XXX: E07-MD1101D V2.0 (with long antenna) needs different AGC (05-00-92) than Neuftech CC1101 (07-00-90)
* TODO: Restart webserver after disconnect/reconnect ethernet
* TODO: Check reload after OTA in distribution

DONE
====

* DONE: Separate web-interface between admin and users
* FIXED: newly added groups/receivers will not give positiom/pct feedback until MCU restart
* FIXED: Modify our subscriptions at MQTT server after changing MQTT root topic in settings
* FIXED: ISO time in auto tab of web-app using wrong time zonen (UTC?)
* FIXED: when moving multiple shutters by automatic, only the first one genereates dynamic movement events (MQTT/Websocket/Telnet). Only after movement is done, the position is reportet for all shutters.
* FIXED: sometimes astro movements are not registered (may depend on ntp sync)
ntpd synced: 16:36:24 (FHEM Server time)
astro movement registered: 21, 23, 25 / -2, +2, 0 / 16:34, 16:38, 16:36 (31 / 16:51) (11 ... 15 /16:36)
astro movement ignored: 22, 24,/ -1, +1 / 16:35, 16:37
* FIXED: Make reading cc1101 registers thread safe
* DONE: bubble help for config options
* DONE: Add RF repeater mode for specified Addresses
* DONE: publish timer data on any change. 
* DONE: Make FHEM devices request automatic/timer info
* DONE: CRLF
* FIXED: 2021-03: Our Timer-Interupt is blocked every 100ms if WLAN is enabled (Ethernet is ok)
* DONE: timer flag i should report state after (not before) saving timer data (k flag)
