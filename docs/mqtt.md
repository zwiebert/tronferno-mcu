## MQTT Client

#### MQTT Topics you can send to:

* tfmcu/+/cmd - Commands like up, down, stop
     * The plus sign represents the ID of the shutter:

```
       tfmcu/23/cmd       # member 3 of group 2
       tfmcu/102030/cmd   # 6 digit hex-ID
       tfmcu/8090a023/cmd # 6 digit hex-ID + group + member


     Examples:

     FHEM Set-List Entries:
        stop tfmcu/25/cmd $EVENT      # topic: 'tfmcu/25/cmd' data: 'stop'. Stops shutter 5 of group 2.
        down tfmcu/101234/cmd $EVENT  # topic: 'tfmcu/101234/cmd' data: 'down'. Move down shutters paired with controller 101234.
        up tfmcu/25/cmd $EVENT        # topic: 'tfmcu/10/cmd' data: 'up'.  Move up all shutters of group 1.
        up tfmcu/25/cmd $EVENT        # topic: 'tfmcu/00/cmd' data: 'up'.  Move up all shutters of all groups.
```


* tfmcu/+/pct - percentages 100 for open, 0 for close,  ? for query

     * the plus sign means the same as in tfmcu/+/cmd above

     * percentages other than 100 and 0 only work for group/members of the configured central unit.
     


```
    Example:
      topic: tfmcu/15/pct data: 33   # set member 5 of group 1 to 33%
      topic: tfmcu/15/pct data: ?    # Current percentage will be published at topic tfmcu/15/pct_out
```

* tfmcu/+/ipct - inverse percentages 0 for open, 100 for close,  ? for query


* tfmcu/cli  - Any [CLI](CLI.md) command can be send here

     * commands can be sent in CLI syntax or in JSON format

     * reply will be sent to tfmcu/cli_out in JSON format

     * if using CLI syntax, don't terminate commands with semicolon or try to send mutiple commands separated by semicolon

     * For better use from FHEM Setlist: you may prepend commands with the word 'cli'. It will be ignored.


```
    Example:
      topic: tfmcu/cli
         data: config all=?
         data: {"config":{"all":"?"}}
         data: cli mcu version=full
         data: {"mcu":{"version":"full"}}


     FHEM setlist:
       cli tfmcu/cli $EVENT          # data: 'config all=?'. This would send $EVENT 'cli config all=?', but the 'cli ' will be ignored.
       config tfmcu/cli $EVENT       # data: 'all=?'. This would send $EVENT 'config all=?'


```


 * tfmcu/gpo/+/level - send 0 or 1 to change level of output pin.  ? for query

```
    Example:
      topic: tfmcu/gpo/22/level data: 1   # Set pin to level 1 (High)
      topic: tfmcu/gpo/22/level data: ?   # Current pin-level will be published at topic tfmcu/gpi/22/level
```


#### MQTT Topics you can subscribe to:

* tfmcu/cli_out - Response (in JSON) of any CLI command sent to tfmcu/cli.

* tfmcu/+/pct_out - current shutter position in percent (+ stands for shutter ID), 100 means open

* tfmcu/+/ipct_out - current shutter position in inverse-percent (+ stands for shutter ID), 100 means closed

* tfmc/gpi/+/level - change of level (0,1) on input pin (must have been set as input pin in config)

* tfmcu/+/rf_out - radio-command (both transmitted or received) as text (stop, down, up, sun-down, sun-up, ...)
